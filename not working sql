this syntax will never works

select * from (
    select rownum,col1,col2,col3,col4,col5,....coln 
    order by cloumn_name_according_to_which_you_wanted_to_sort desc
)
group by condition
having rownum='&n';

because reason behind that was the 
sql start from the  having clause if suppose we enter the value rownum 4 then 
1st)sql will identify the 7 row in the table 
2nd) sql will go to the group by check the condition according to taht condition it will make the group
3rd) sql order by  will arrange the data according to the column we pass  it 
4th) sql will select the column we provide
5th) error wiil apper at this because all of the above are group level working  this( *= all) will go select all data it goes record level (row level) row level and column level caluse/condition  never work together
